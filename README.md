# SpringExample
A simple example of how to make a RESTful CRUD API Spring Boot project
You will need to create a MySQL database called 'tu_base_de_datos'' with the table 'productos' for it to work correctly. I have uploaded my own version of this SQL database here. It has to be opened on port 3306.
Once the application is started, you will be able to see all the products at http://localhost:8080/api/productos.
